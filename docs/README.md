# Real-Time Narrative Advertising (RTNA) Platform

This repository contains the code for a Real-Time Narrative Advertising (RTNA) platform, a revolutionary approach to in-game advertising that leverages generative AI to weave brands and products seamlessly into the narrative of a game in real-time.

## Design Decisions and Standards

**Modular Design:** The project follows a modular design approach, dividing the functionalities into distinct modules for better organization, reusability, and maintainability.

**Key Modules:**

* **`rtna_core`:** Contains the core functionalities of the RTNA system, including narrative generation, data analysis, feedback loop, and game integration.
* **`rtna_advertising`:** Focuses on functionalities related to advertisers, such as advertiser input processing and reporting.
* **`rtna_user_interface`:** Handles the user interface aspects of the RTNA system (if applicable).
* **`tests`:** Contains tests for the different modules.

**Coding Standards:**

* **Python:** The project is written in Python, adhering to PEP 8 style guidelines for code readability and consistency.
* **Docstrings:** Comprehensive docstrings are used to document functions, classes, and modules, providing clear explanations of their purpose and usage.
* **Unit Tests:** Unit tests are implemented to ensure the correctness of individual modules.

**Technology Choices:**

* **Generative AI:** The specific AI technology used for narrative generation will be determined based on further research and experimentation.
* **Data Analysis:** Libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn will likely be used for data analysis and processing.
* **Game Integration:** The integration method will depend on the specific game engine and platform.

**Explanation of Modules:**

* **`rtna_core`:** This module contains the core functionalities of the RTNA system.
    * **`narrative_generation`:** Responsible for generating the narrative, including structuring and adapting it based on player actions and advertiser input.
    * **`data_analysis`:** Handles data collection and analysis to measure the effectiveness of the advertising.
    * **`feedback_loop`:** Processes feedback from the data analysis to adapt the narrative in real-time.
    * **`game_integration`:** Manages the integration of the RTNA system with the game.

* **`rtna_advertising`:** This module focuses on functionalities related to advertisers.
    * **`advertiser_input`:** Processes input from advertisers, including product information and advertising goals.
    * **`reporting`:** Generates reports on the performance of the advertised products in the game.

* **`rtna_user_interface`:** This module would handle the user interface aspects of the RTNA system (if applicable).

* **`tests`:** Contains tests for the different modules.
